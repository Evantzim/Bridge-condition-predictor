# Bridge-condition-predictor

## Summary
An app which can predict the condition of a bridge and store the info and the location
## Languages and Libraries Used
Sklearn, python, streamlit, pandas, numpy were used for this project.
## Key Learnings
Presentation skills, Combining different parts of data science in one notebook, Training data and predict a new entry, Store data with session state and save them to the memory. 
## Challenges Overcame
A challenge was the fact after the app was working, suddenly streamlit was loading indefinitely, but after a while I managed to spot the problem and I fixed it.
## Additional Reflections
Working first time without any guidance for the final project was very beneficial for me, to test what I have learned and how I can overcome challenges when they arise in the near future
